## Written Report
* Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
    * Given the provided data, we can draw a few conclusions about the crowdfunding campaign. Out of a wide range companies, "theaters" make up a large portion of crowdfunding campaigns. We can narrow this down to sub-categories, where "plays" make up a large portion of crowdfunding campaigns.
    * By comparison, "journalism" makes up the smallest portion of crowdfunding campaigns. In the given sub-categories, "world music" made up the smallest portion with a total of 3 crowdfunded campaigns.
    * Comparing the data by months, we can note that July had the most campaigns with a total of 93.  July also had the most successful campaigns with 58 reaching their goals. On the other side of the spectrum, September had the least amount with a total of 73 campaigns. January had the most failed campaigns with a total of 36, out of a total of 91. With more campaigns, you'll get more successes and more fails as well.

* What are some limitations of this dataset?
    * Limitations of the data set include the categories and sub-categories. Specifically, they seem to lack STEM related information. When analyzing the parent company categories, only one is technology and the rest can make up various categories that can be classefied under arts, music, and other non-STEM fields. This data set doesn't offer a full picture with a wide range of different categories.
    * Another limitation is the scope of the countries included. While many countries are included, we need to compare the values of the currencies. Currency between countries can vary, and it could mean that if we converted all currencies to a single unit, that we would get different results. 


* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
    * For additional analysis, we could create other tables and graphs to compare the length of time that a crowdfunding campaign ran compared to their success/fail rate. We could also compare the successes/fails depending on country. 
    * Other columns could be added to convert the amounts to a single currency and compare the results. However, we must be carecul with our conclusions and keep in mind the different econmoic situtions each country may differ in.

## Statistical Analysis
Comparing the mean and median values of both the successful and unsuccessful campaigns, we can see that the mean is in both cases significantly higher than the median. Because of this, we can conclude that that the data is not normally distributed, which means that median would be a better at summarizing the data.

There is more variability with the successful campaigns. This makes sense becuase the range between minimum and maximum is greater with successful campaigns compared to failed campaigns. The standard deviation is also greater in successful campaigns, meaning that there is more variability.
